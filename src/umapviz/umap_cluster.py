        ----------
        min_cluster_size: int
            This is a parameter from hdbscan.HDBSCAN algorithm. From docs: "Set it to
            the smallest size grouping that you wish to consider a cluster"
        use_umap_preprocessing: bool
            Option to choose whether to reduce the data dimensionality by using UMAP
            (with metric specified during instantiation). If True, this may help in
            finding clusters because it makes samples closer (higher density helps
            HDBSCAN algorithm). On the other hand the sample density (distances) is not
            preserved by UMAP algorithm so if the option is set to True, HDBSCAN is not
            really detecting clusters: only UMAP is.
        umap_components: int
            UMAP embedding number of dimensions. Higher values lead to more dimensional
            embeddings and lower density, but the HDBSCAN algorithm has a more important
            role in identifying the clusters (otherwise UMAP is already separating data
            into clusters). Default set to 10.
        umap_min_distance: float
            Minimum distance used for UMAP algorithm.
        umap_n_neighbors: int
            Number of neighbors used for UMAP algorithm.
        min_samples
        cluster_selection_epsilon
        cluster_metric: function
            This is a function which calculates the distances between two vectors

            by HDBSCAN algorithm to compute distances. This function should be written
